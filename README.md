## *A miniature piano running on an Arduino*

This repository contains code to create a miniature piano using an Arduino.

This code is based off the code previously written for [Project Beethoven](https://github.com/sa-fx/arduino-keyboard). The original code has since been archived, allowing this repository to host the new version of the code.
